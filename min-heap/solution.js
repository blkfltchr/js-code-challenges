// Min Heap

// You can think of a heap as something like a binary search tree where each node has 
// at least 2 child nodes. For a min heap, the parent nodes are less than their two 
// children. The order on every level of the heap doesn’t matter, what does matter is 
// that each level is filled from leftChild to rightChild.

// It helps to use arrays to implement min heap. Here you can see our heap represented 
// as an array:

// [10, 14, 19, 26, 31, 42, 27, 44, 35, 33]

// [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10]

// If the parent node is `i`, the leftChild child is `i * 2` and the rightChild child 
// is `i * 2 + 1`

// 26 is the parent, 44 is its leftChild child and 35 is its rightChild child.

// To make this work, you’ve got to make `index[0] = null`

// The equation to find the parent is `parent = floor(i / 2)`

// To visualize a MinHeap, I found this link: 
// https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Heap.html

// When you insert a number that is smaller than the parent nodes, here is what happens

// Basically, it goes to the end of the heap, and it checks its parents one by one, to 
// see where it belongs.

// When you delete the smallest node, index[1] is deleted, the last node is popped to 
// index[1] and then the heap sorts the remaining nodes by checking parent against 
// children to see which is bigger.


function MinHeap() {

	// initialize an array where index[0] = null
	let heap = [null];

	return {

		// insert a number
		insert(num) {
			// push it to the back of the array 
			heap.push(num);
			// check that the heap is more than 2
			if (heap.length > 2) {
				// create an index for the inserted number
				let index = heap.length - 1;
				// start a check as long the newly inserted index is less than its parent (see the parent equation above)
